# plunzer
Plunzer is a 2D single player endless shooter game, which gives the player multiple points for killing each type of the opposition entity, the difficulty increases as your score does. I have built this using Godot Engine, GD script, aseprite, tilesetter, and hosted it on Amazon Web Services. This project has been done solely by me.

this code is based on GODOT 3 and **WILL NOT WORK** IN GODOT 4
